Details
====================
The `O. Henry Pun-Off World Championships <http://punoff.com/>`_ take place 
at `Brush Park <http://austinparks.org/our-parks.html?parkid=220>`_ in 
downtown Austin at 409 E. 5th Street.  The festivities start at 11 AM and
the pun get into full sling at noon.  

After this any and all are welcome to come back to 
`my place <https://goo.gl/maps/I3oMv>`_ for what can only be described as the 
best house party of 2015 that hasn't happened yet! People are welcome to 
start showing up after the Pun-Off finishes, which is typically between 
6 - 7 PM. We'll probably order out dinner from somewhere, if there is interest. 

I hope to you at some point on May 9th!

`Don't forget to RSVP! <http://goo.gl/forms/iIFmBTEq8T>`_
